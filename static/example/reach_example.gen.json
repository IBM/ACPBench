    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 5 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l0, with the car c2 on board. The cars are at locations as follows: c3, c0, and c1 are at l0; c4 is at l1. The available propositions are: (at-ferry ?l) - The ferry is at ?l location, (at ?c ?l) - Car ?c is at location ?l, (empty-ferry) - The ferry is empty, and (on ?c) - Ferry has car ?c on board.",

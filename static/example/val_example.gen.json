    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 5 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l0 location and it is empty. The cars are at locations as follows: c3, c1, c0, and c2 are at l0; c4 is at l1. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Car c3 is at location l0, Car c4 is at location l0, Car c1 is at location l0, Car c0 is at location l1, and Car c2 is at location l1. The available actions are: (sail ?from ?to) - sail from location ?from to location ?to, (board ?car ?loc) - board the car ?car at the location ?loc, and (debark ?car ?loc) - debark the car ?car from the ferry to location ?loc.",
    "question": "What is the first inapplicable action in the next sequence of actions: \"(board c2 l0) (debark c2 l0) (board c2 l0) (sail l0 l1) (board c2 l1) (board c4 l1) (sail l1 l0) (debark c4 l0) (board c0 l0) (sail l0 l1) (debark c0 l1) (sail l1 l0)\"?",

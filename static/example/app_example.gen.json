    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 20 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l0, with the car c2 on board. The cars are at locations as follows: c0, c3, c15, c10, c8, c6, and c9 are at l0; c18, c17, c16, c4, c19, c5, c13, c7, c1, c12, c14, and c11 are at l1. The available actions are: (sail ?from ?to) - travel by sea from location ?from to location ?to, (board ?car ?loc) - load the car ?car at location ?loc on to the ferry, and (debark ?car ?loc) - unload the car ?car from the ferry to location ?loc.",

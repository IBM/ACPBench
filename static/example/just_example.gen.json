    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 2 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l0 location and it is empty. The cars are at locations as follows: c1 and c0 are at l0. The available actions are: (sail ?from ?to) - sail from location ?from to location ?to, (board ?car ?loc) - board the car ?car at the location ?loc, and (debark ?car ?loc) - debark the car ?car to location ?loc from the ferry. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Car c1 is at location l1 and Car c0 is at location l1.",

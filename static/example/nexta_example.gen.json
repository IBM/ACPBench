    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 5 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l1 location and it is empty. The cars are at locations as follows: c0, c4, and c1 are at l0; c3 and c2 are at l1. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Car c0 is at location l1, Car c4 is at location l0, Car c1 is at location l0, Car c3 is at location l0, and Car c2 is at location l1. The available actions are: (sail ?from ?to) - travel by sea from location ?from to location ?to, (board ?car ?loc) - board the car ?car at the location ?loc, and (debark ?car ?loc) - debark the car ?car from the ferry to location ?loc.",

    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 10 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l1, with the car c2 on board. The cars are at locations as follows: c5, c9, and c4 are at l1; c3, c0, c1, c6, c7, and c8 are at l0. The available propositions are: (at-ferry ?l) - The ferry is at ?l location, (at ?c ?l) - Car ?c is at location ?l, (empty-ferry) - The ferry is empty, and (on ?c) - Ferry has car ?c on board.",
    "question": "Break down the outcomes of performing the action \"debark car c2 to location l1 from the ferry\" into two lists, positive effects and negative effects. Positive effects are the propositions that are false in the current state but will become true after performing the action. Negative effects are the propositions that are true in the current state and will become false after performing the action.",

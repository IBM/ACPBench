    "context": "This is a ferry domain, where the task is to transport cars from their start to their goal locations, using a ferry. Each location is accessible by ferry from each other location. The cars can be debarked or boarded, and the ferry can carry only one car at a time. \nThere are 2 locations and 10 cars, numbered consecutively. \nCurrently, the ferry is at l1, with the car c6 on board. The cars are at locations as follows: c9, c4, and c2 are at l1; c1, c7, c3, c0, c5, and c8 are at l0. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Car c9 is at location l1, Car c4 is at location l0, Car c6 is at location l0, Car c1 is at location l0, Car c7 is at location l0, Car c2 is at location l1, Car c3 is at location l1, Car c0 is at location l0, Car c5 is at location l0, and Car c8 is at location l0. The available propositions are: (at-ferry ?l) - The ferry is at ?l location, (at ?c ?l) - Car ?c is at location ?l, (empty-ferry) - The ferry is empty, and (on ?c) - Car ?c is on board the ferry.",

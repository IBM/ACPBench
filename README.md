ACPBench is a dataset to evaluate reasoning ability of LLMs about Action, Change, and Planning. It consists of 7 tasks.

**1. Applicability (app)**, checks which actions are applicable in a state.

>
> Checkout our [blog](https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench/blog.html) to get more insight on each of these tasks, and why we need yet another question-answering dataset.


> [!WARNING]
>
> ACP Bench is an evolving dataset collection. We may add different tasks and domains to this collection in time. 



## üî• Getting Started


> [!TIP]
>
> [ACPBench](https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench) ‚ù§Ô∏è [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) ‚ù§Ô∏è [hugging-face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibm/ACPBench)! 
>
> ACPBench is integrated with lm-evaluation-harness and hugging-face to facilitate quick evaluation of existing pretrained models as well as custom finetuned models.


We release dev and test sets for each task in this repo. The dev set contains 40 examples with answers that can be used for validation, development purposes. Refer to the [development guide](#development-guide) below to see how to quickly estimate the performance of your model on dev or test set. 

### Development Guide

You can either use your model with lm-eval-harness or custom implementation to generate outputs. We provide lm-eval-harness config files for evaluation. For custom implementation, you can either use ['exact_match' metric](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/exact_match) from hugging face, or produce json file consistent with lm-eval-harness and use the provided [evaluation_script.py](./evaluation_script.py). 


**Using LM-eval-harness**


To evaluate your model on ACPBench dev set using LM-eval-harness, use the following config files and the tasks.


```
lm_eval --model <your-model> \
    --model_args <model-args> \
    --tasks acp \
    --output <output-folder> \
    --log_samples \
    --include_path ./configs/tasks \
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To evaluate your model on ACPBench test set using LM-eval-harness, update the `test_split` in the yaml file to `test`.

**Custom**

To use [evaluation_script.py](./evaluation_script.py) to obtain the score, dump the generated outputs for each example in the lm-eval format shown below. Here, `doc` is the original example, `resp` is the generated response (showing 5 samples here) from the model and `filtered_resps` is the answer to the question (obtained by processing the `resp`).

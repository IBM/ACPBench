    "context": "A set of robots use different colors to paint patterns in floor tiles. The robots can move around the floor tiles in four directions (up, down, left and right). Robots paint with one color at a time, but can change their spray guns to any available color. However, robots can only paint the tile that is in front (up) and behind (down) them, and once a tile has been painted no robot can stand on it. Robots need to paint a grid with black and white, where the cell color is alternated always. There are 2 robots and 9 tiles. The tiles locations are: tile_8 is to the right of tile_7, tile_3 is to the right of tile_2, tile_9 is to the right of tile_8, tile_5 is to the right of tile_4, tile_2 is to the right of tile_1, and tile_6 is to the right of tile_5. Further, tile_6 is down from tile_9, tile_1 is down from tile_4, tile_5 is down from tile_8, tile_4 is down from tile_7, tile_3 is down from tile_6, and tile_2 is down from tile_5 Currently, robot robot2 is at tile_3 and holding color white and robot robot1 is at tile_1 and holding color white; tile_2, tile_6, tile_5, tile_4, and tile_9 are clear; tile_7 is painted black and tile_8 is painted white.",

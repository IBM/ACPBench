    "context": "This is a Rovers domain where rovers must navigate between waypoints gathering data and transmitting it back to a lander. Rovers cannot navigate to all waypoints and this makes particular routes impassable to some of the rovers. Data transmission is also constrained by the visibility of the lander from the waypoints. \nThere are 2 rovers, 3 waypoints, 2 stores, 3 cameras, 3 objectives numbered consecutively. Further, there is 1 lander and 3 modes for the camera namely colour, high resolution, and low resolution.  \nRover(s) rover0 and rover1 are equipped for soil analysis. Rover(s) rover0 is equipped for rock analysis. Rover(s) rover0 and rover1 are equipped for imaging. Rover rover0 has store store0. Rover rover1 has store store1. Rover rover1 has camera0 and camera1 on board. Rover rover0 has camera2 on board. Camera camera2 can be calibrated on objective2. Camera camera0 can be calibrated on objective0. Camera camera1 can be calibrated on objective0. Camera camera2 supports high_res. Camera camera1 supports high_res. Camera camera0 supports low_res and colour. Rover rover0 can traverse from waypoint0 to waypoint1, waypoint1 to waypoint0, waypoint1 to waypoint2, waypoint2 to waypoint1. Rover rover1 can traverse from waypoint1 to waypoint2, waypoint2 to waypoint1, waypoint1 to waypoint0, waypoint0 to waypoint1. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint1: waypoint0 and waypoint2. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint0: waypoint2 and waypoint1. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint2: waypoint1 and waypoint0. Objective objective0 is visible from waypoint2. Objective objective1 is visible from waypoint0 and waypoint1. Objective objective2 is visible from waypoint0. Lander general is at waypoint waypoint1.  \nCurrently, Rover rover0 is at waypoint0. Rover rover1 is at waypoint2. Soil can be sampled at the following location(s): waypoint0. Rovers rover0 and rover1 are available. Rock data was communicated from waypoint waypoint0; Rover rover0 has rock analyzed in waypoint waypoint0. Rover rover1 has image objective0 in mode low_res.

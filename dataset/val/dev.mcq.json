Robots paint with one color at a time, but can change their spray guns to any available color. However, robots can only paint the tile that is in front (up) and behind (down) them, and once a tile has been painted no robot can stand on it. Robots need to paint a grid with black and white, where the cell color is alternated always. There are 9 tiles and 2 robots. The tiles locations are: tile_6 is to the right of tile_5, tile_2 is to the right of tile_1, tile_9 is to the right of tile_8, tile_8 is to the right of tile_7, tile_3 is to the right of tile_2, and tile_5 is to the right of tile_4.

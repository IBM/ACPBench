Further, tile_5 is down from tile_8, tile_3 is down from tile_6, tile_2 is down from tile_5, tile_9 is down from tile_12, tile_4 is down from tile_7, tile_7 is down from tile_10, tile_8 is down from tile_11, tile_1 is down from tile_4, and tile_6 is down from tile_9 Currently, robot robot1 is at tile_3 and holding color white and robot robot2 is at tile_6 and holding color black; tile_8, tile_1, tile_2, tile_5, tile_4, tile_7, and tile_9 are clear; tile_10 is painted white, tile_11 is painted black, and tile_12 is painted white.",
    "question": "Will the fact \"tile_9 is clear\" hold after performing the action \"paint tile tile_9 above tile tile_6 with color black using robot robot2\" in the current state?",
    "answer": "no"
